# Deciding what kind of QC to do in R, and how to carry it out

This flowchart is provided to help with deciding what kind of QC to carry out.
The two scenarios described in section 3 are shown in the flowchart.  Underneath
the flowchart, further detail is provided on the different QC methods shown.

```



## Scenario 1: further detail  
1. Compare to 'old method' e.g. SQL, Excel, Stata  
This method of QC is more likely to be used where there is an existing piece of
work that has been done using the 'old method' e.g. SQL, Excel, Stata.  For example, a piece of
survey analysis may have been carried out using Stata and Excel a couple of years
ago, and so the easiest way to QC the new R script is to make it run the same analysis
on the same data as the Stata and Excel piece of work, and compare the results. If a 
piece of work using the 'old method' has not been carried out previously to compare to,
then it is probably best to write an independent piece of R code and then compare the
results (see 3 below). This will provide an opportunity for the QCing analyst to 
develop their R skills.
2. Compare to published figures
If the results of a new R script compare well with published figures, e.g. for 
a number of different age-standardised mortality rates, then it can reasonably 
be assumed that the R script is working well and the QC can be passed.  However, 
it would still be necessary to go through the script and complete the QC checks
listed in section 5.2.  
3. Write your own R code and then compare the results  
Here, the QCing analyst writes an independent piece of R code to produce the same
statistics. This is preferred to the QCing analyst simply checking through the 
analyst's code, because it is all too easy to read someone else's code and think it
looks OK, when in fact there are hidden issues that would only come to light when 
writing independent code.  This can be time-consuming, but provides an 
opportunity to develop R skills. 

## Scenario 2: further detail  
1. Input: check data coming in  
The aim of this step is to check that data coming into the pipeline, e.g. from
a SQL database or a survey dataset, is in a fit state to be run through
the R script. For example: 
* Is the number of rows within the right ballpark, or is a load of data missing?
* Are there any missing values?
* Have any of the data types changes, e.g. a column that was previously character
now coming in as a factor type?

These checks are required to prevent the R script from producing figures that
might appear OK, but are actually erroneous due to changes in the underlying data.
Ideally, checks should be automated as much as possible within an R script, to 
make the process more efficient. For example, the Covid Recovery Profile uses 
functions to check incoming data, so that the analyst running the script can 
simply look through the results of the checks, rather than having to run each 
check manually.

2. Review the code  
As described in section 5.3, the aim of the code review is to check that the code
is doing what it is meant to do.  If the code was only QC'd recently, and
is now being run to update the indicators, then a code review is not required.
However, if six months to a year has passed since the code was originally QC'd, 
it is suggested that the QCing analyst carries out a code review, as described
in section 5.3.  
Note that some sections of the code may have been improved, e.g. repetitive code
turned into a function, or new code may have been added since the original full
QC of the script. If this is the case then check whether these amendments have 
been fully QC'd previously, and if not then do so at this point.

3. Sense check the results  
The QCing analyst should check that trends look OK, and compare well to published
figures or previous analyses carried out within OCAT. See prompts within 
section 5.3. This acts as a final check, and in the past has been known to uncover
errors within an analysis that have passed through QC.
